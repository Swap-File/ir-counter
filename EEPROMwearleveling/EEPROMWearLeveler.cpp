 *  Created by Nabil Tewolde, May 14, 2012.
 *  Released into the public domain.
 *  Modified by Michael Moring, March 7, 2014.
 *  This library performs EEPROM wear leveling by spreading out writes across
 *  multiple address by following the techniques documented by Atmel
 *  (http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2526.pdf). It is not memory efficient,
 *  but provides guaranteed reliability for a variable number of paramaters.
 *
 *  Facts:
 *
 *  AVR_EEPROM_SIZE/4 is the maximum number of variables that can be used with a
 *  guarantee of 200 000 erase/write cycles each. Any more than that and the
 *  library reverts back to one variable per address space providing no benefit
 *
 *  The maximum number of writes with 1 variable is 100 000 * (AVR_EEPROM_SIZE/2)
 *
 *  If the EEPROM size is not multiple of the number of variables there will
 *  be wasted space.
 *
 *
 *  The EEPROM in AVRs are rated for 100 000 erase/write cycles. By alternating
 *  writes across two memory address this number increase to 200 000. Three
 *  memory addresses gives you 300 000 writes and so on. To automate this
 *  process a status buffer is used to keep track of where the next write should
 *  be. The status buffer must also be the same length as the parameter buffer
 *  because wear leveling must be performed on it as well. When the first value,
 *  7, is written to the parameter buffer the corresponding element in the
 *  status buffer is incremented as shown in the figure below.
 *
 *  Note: The status buffer must be initialized to zero by calling clear() before
 *        any writes occur.
 *
 *      <------------------- EEPROM -------------------->
 *      0                                               N
 *      -------------------------------------------------
 *          Parameter Buffer    |     Status Buffer     |
 *      -------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Initial state.
 *      [ 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 *
 *      First write is a 7. This corresponding position
 *      in the status buffer is incremented.
 *      [ 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 *
 *      A second value, 4, is written to the parameter buffer
 *      and the second element in the status buffer becomes
 *      the previous element, 1 in this case, plus 1.
 *      [ 7 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 *
 *      And so on
 *      [ 7 | 4 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 *
 *
 *  If the previous element + 1 does not equal the next element then that is
 *  where the next write should occur. Take a look at some examples.
 *
 *      Compute the differences by starting at the first
 *      element and wrapping around.
 *      1st element: 0 + 1 = 1 = 1st element (move on)
 *      2nd element: 1 + 1 = 2 = 2nd element (move on)
 *      3rd element: 2 + 1 = 3 = 3rd element (move on)
 *      4th element: 3 + 1 = 4 != 4th element (next write occurs here)
 *
 *      [ 7 | 4 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 ]
 *                                            ^
 *                                            |
 *
 *      This also works on the first element because it is
 *      a circular buffer.
 *      x = don't care
 *      1st element: 6 + 1 = 7 != first element (next write occurs here)
 *
 *      [ x | x | x | x | x | x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 ]
 *                                ^
 *                                |
 *
 *      Another edge case to consider is when the incrementing values
 *      wrap around at 256 because we are writing bytes. With the
 *      following buffer we know the next write is at the 3rd element
 *      because 255 + 1 = 0 != 250 assuming we are using byte arithmetic.
 *
 *      [ x | x | x | x | x | x | 254 | 255 | 250 | 251 | 252 | 253 ]
 *                                             ^
 *                                             |
 *
 *      After we write at element 3 the status buffer is incremented
 *      to the next value using byte arithmetic and looks like this.
 *      255 + 1 = 0
 *      [ x | x | x | x | x | x | 254 | 255 |  0  | 251 | 252 | 253 ]
 *
 *      Doing the math we see that element 4 is next to be written to.
 *      1st element: 253 + 1 = 254 = 1st element (move on)
 *      2nd element: 254 + 1 = 255 = 2nd element (move on)
 *      3rd element: 255 + 1 = 0 = 3rd element (move on)
 *      4rd element: 0 + 1 = 1 != 4th element  (next write occurs here)
 *                                             ^
 *                                             |
